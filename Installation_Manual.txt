For the development, I've used Yeoman Fullstack for the project setup. The development is done over MEAN stack.
Instead of installing MongoDB on sytem, I've used the online MongoDB (mlab).

|||||||||||****************Installations required before running code****************|||||||||||
if you are using ubuntu (I've used the same), then the installation process goes like this :

1. Firstly we need to install 'yo', 'gulp-cli' and 'generator-angular-fullstack'
   COMMAND: npm install -g yo gulp-cli generator-angular-fullstack
   if error occurs then most probably it would be of 'node-gyp' not being there.
   Solution: install node-gyp on your system.

2. Now Run yeoman fullstack.
   COMMAND: yo angular-fullstack

   \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\PRE-REQUISITES///////////////////////////////
   *****************In case error is 'no curl found'*****************
   1. You have to install curl on your system
      command:  sudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
                sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev
                curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.16.1/install.sh | sh

                (OR)
                sudo apt-get install php5-curl /****(ALTERNATIVELY)

   2. Time to install nodejs.
      command: sudo apt-get install -y nodejs /***(if error occurs then use the next command and drop this one)
               sudo apt-get install -y nodejs --force-yes /***(Only in case of error with above command)

   3. Time to install npm
      command: sudo apt-get install npm

   4. Time to install nodejs
      command: sudo apt-get install -y nodejs

   5. All set, only yeoman fullstack needs to be installed
      command: sudo npm install -g yo gulp-cli generator-angular-fullstack
      CHOICES TO BE MADE: (build system: gulp; testing: Jasmine; scripts: Babel(JS);Module Systems: Webpack;
                           Markup: HTML; Stylesheet: CSS; Angular routes: ngRoute; CSS Frameworks: UI Bootstrap;
                           Server Scripts: Babel(Javascript);Database: MongoDB;Authentication boilerplate: Yes;
                           oAuth integrations: Google;Socket.io integration: Yes)

   6. To run go to the the parent directory in which node_modules are installed
      command: gulp serve

   7. A webpage will open on http://localhost:3000 on your system and database seeding starts on mlab

   8. To check mlab database :
                              i. Go to mlab.
                              ii. Sign in with credentials: username : drunk_knight_
                                                            password : piyush_mlab1
                              iii. select the database with name 'notification_panel_wingify' and switch to 'things' collection.

//////In case the [nodemon] crashes then exit the terminal and again run gulp serve [step 6].
